      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p id="description">
        I'm Liam Colley. 22 Years old based in Cardiff, Wales. I study Computer
        Science at Cardiff University, and have worked on numerous Web
        Development projects in my free time. I am currently looking for a
        Junior Web Development/Software Engineer position to kickstart my tech
        career doing something I have grown to love. I am open to relocation
        given that I am given appropriate time and help. You can find my hobby
        projects and contact details below.
